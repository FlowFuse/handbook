### Product Demos

Product demos are held internally to rapidly assess the state of a feature set
and allow for synchronous validation of feature sets. Each demo is open to the
whole company to allow for cross functional learning and development.

A demo consists of a higher level business goal to achieve and is graded against
that goal. Once that goal is set, the goal needs to broken down into smaller
steps to create a script. For each meeting a participant should be marked as
demo leader, going through the steps and try and achieve a successful demo.

The demo itself is a recorded meeting where the demo leader goes through the
script. It's anticipated that demos surface friction or fail completely. When
problems, challenges, and/or improvement-ideas arise another participant should
document these along with the script. When the demo is completed, these tasks
are discussed and prioritized.

Afterwards the next demo is scheduled, and the next demo-leader is chosen.

### Customer calls

FlowForge is fortunate to have a community the size of Node-REDs community. The
product organisation should constantly be in touch with the community to
understand their challenges, current solutions, and learn why they have or
haven't adopted FlowForge.

For each call document all the learnings to share internally, to start; make a
copy of [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gya2WZTJW0G2CxlsJguLDCJI3eHRILJzd9ICsn5QTs)
and roughly follow the questions listed.
