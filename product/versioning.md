# Versioning

## 1.0

The 1.0 Release of FlowForge represents a significant milestone, we are making a statement to our customers about the product.

Therefore the following are considerations & requirements in order to be able to stand behind that statement.

- We have the admin features required to manage the platform at an appropriate scale.
- We have the monitoring and alerting features to run a commercial SaaS platform.
- We have a suitable licensing model in place
- The pricing model is sufficiently mature and implemented in the platform as to support our plans for the 1.x timeline. 
- The devices feature is capable of supporting at least one real world use case end to end.
- Both the Forge app and Device Agent are at 1.0 and the interface between them is locked, such that agents running 1.0 can connect to any 1.x forge application.


### Backports

Once 1.0 has been released the 0.x line will become deprecated, in general no fixes will be backported to the 0.x line, critical security updates may be considered on a case by case basis.

The 1.x line will be supported for at least 12 months from the first release of 1.0, this means that customers may need to update to a 1.x release in order to receive fixes and new features. Even after the release of 2.0 fixes will be backported into the last 1.x release for the duration of the support period.

## 2.0
The 2.0 release may happen within the period that 1.0 is still supported, timing and scope for 2.0 is to be determined.
