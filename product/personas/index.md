# Personas

Personas are fictional characters that represent the different users we expect to interact with FlowForge as a brand and/or platform. Personas are a generalized way of talking about the ideal target we are aiming to communicate with and design for. 

Personas help us not only define our messaging and marketing delivery, but also our product. Keeping personas in mind allows us to use the correct language and make the best decisions to address their specific problems and pain points. At FlowForge, we have many personas that will evolve over time.

## Persona Template

### Profile

- **Name**: Naming your Persona is very important to increase empathy with them. Having them named is shown to make relating to their situation easier to do, and result in better prodict decisions.
- **Picture**: What does the persona look like? Choose a realistic and believable picture.
- **Age**: Choose a realistic age for the persona, this can also be a range if needs be, but try to keep it fairly precise.


### Details

- **Occupation**: What is their professional occupation? This doesn't have to correlate directly to why they're a Persona, but can play a very important role defining them.
- **Purchasing Role**: Where in the hierarchy of a purchasing decision do they sit, and to what scale could we expect such a decision to bring in financially?
- **Technical Skillset**: This is a FlowForge-specific characteristic we've introduced for our Personas. It's important as a low-code platform to consider technical skillsets, that developers or those in the technical industry such as ourselves may take for granted, and even _how_ they've learned their technical skillset, should they have one.
- **Node-RED Experience**: Another FlowForge-specific detail. This helps us frame the sales/marketing strategy for this Persona, and will also frame explanations of what FlowForge is and does.
- **Additional information**: A catch-all for any other remarks or comments to be made for the persona.


### Behaviours

- **Interests**: What personal and professional interests does this person have?

- **Motivations**: Why does this persona do what they do? What drives them?

- **Influences**: Where do they get their opinions from? What sources of information influence their own decision making?

- **Needs & Expectations**: What does this persona need in their day-to-day life to help them? What are their baseline expectiations for what "good" or "valuable" looks like?


### Goals

What problem does the persona want to solve, or which benefit does the character seek? Why would the persona want to use or buy FlowForge?

- **Job To Be Done**: In the context of the persona, what are they trying to achieve?
- **Challenges**: What are their regular blockers and pain points when trying to work towards their goals?
