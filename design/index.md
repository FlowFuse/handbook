## Process

### Scheduling

As per our [Development Cadence](../development#cadence), we release a new version of FlowForge every four weeks. Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets) two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning, i.e. 6 weeks ahead of the release. 

In getting a headstart on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.

### Design Thinking

At FlowForge, we practice Design Thinking when considering our UI design and wider decisions influencing the overall user experience of FlowForge.

> Design Thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.
>
> -- <cite>[_Design Thinking, Interaction Design Foundation_](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking)</cite>

As designers and developers, empathising with our users will lead to a better product. When proposing new feature ideas, concepts and changes to existing UX, arguments should always be considered from the perspective of our users. 

Whilst most of the output from our Design Thinking workshops and sessions can be found within [FigJam](#figjam-(more-info)), we have also written up some of our [Design Thinking Findings here](./design-thinking).

## Branding Guidelines

For FlowForge Assets (e.g. logos, pictograms, and raw design files), please look in the [`/design/Media`](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1guBnBUrIiRXuK6vsik_NIXIhtE1cZRRa) folder on Google Drive.

A breakdown of our branding guidelines details on our Branding guidelines can  be found [here](./branding.md)

## Tools

If you ever require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](../peopleops#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Figma ([more info](https://www.figma.com/))

Figma is used to construct mid- and high-fidelity designs. We have two primary working documents for design iterations:

- Website
- Platform

Underlying each of these Figma files is a standardised component library, which coincides with FlowForge's `forge-ui-component` library.

### FigJam ([more info](https://www.figma.com/figjam/))

Figjam, a sister-product of Figma, is a cloud-hosted white boarding tool that enables remote, digital collaboration. 

Any in-person whiteboard discussions should have a documented digitial copy. Additionally, FigJam can be used to host and run digital workshops.


### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

For visual design elements of the user interface and public-facing material, we predominantly use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects.

- **Illustrator** provides us tooling to create high-quality, static SVG assets to suplement the user experience on both the website and the FlowForge platform.

- **After Effects** enables the generation of animated SVG elements. In particular, we work with [Lottie Files](https://lottiefiles.com/) for injection into both our website and FlowForge platform.

Other tools included in the Creative Cloud suite that may be useful include:

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

- **Premiere Pro** is an excellent video-editing software.

### Blender ([more info](https://blender.org))

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset. It can be used to create static renders of 3d assets, or entire 2d & 3d animations. 

## Content
### Websites

- All written content should be in UK English.
- All page titles should summarise the content, keep the URL length as short as practical and use [Kebab Case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case).
- All images should use informative [alt tags](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/tips/) which clearly describe the point of an image rather than all the details. Alt tags should be no longer than 60 characters.
- When mentioning [FlowForge Concepts](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/concepts/) (terminology) where possible we should link to an explanation of that concept.
- All written content should use the [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma). We believe the Oxford Comma reduces the ambiguity of written technical content.

### Social Media, Marketing & PR

It's important we understand what we communicate, to whom, how, and when. This sets out our principles for social media, marketing, and PR communications.

### Content Types

Content should be published to the appropriate channels, the types of published content we currently produce are as follows.

#### Release

Major releases of FlowForge, the timing of these releases are governed by our [development cadence](https://flowforge.com/handbook/development/#cadence).

#### Patch

Patch between releases, these will happen as needed and may be at short notice.

#### Planned Downtime

As soon as we are aware of planned downtime we should publish the information, that should be at least one week before the downtime.

#### Outage

If we experience unplanned downtime we should communicate in near real time to keep our users and stakeholders up to date with the situation.

#### Corporate Comms

Major company news such as investment rounds should be communicated at the time agreed with the relevant parties involved. We strive to make this information public as soon as practical and effective.

#### Newsletter

Monthly newsletter published at the start of each calendar month covering news from the prior month.

#### How To

Technical guides, published once per week.

### Channel Content Guidance

#### Blog

Content should be eloquent and an appropriate length to communicate the message.

#### Mailing List

Content should be eloquent and an appropriate length to communicate the message.

#### Twitter

Keep it short, Tweets should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more.

#### Youtube

Videos should:

- Include opening and closing idents.
- Be clear in what they are communicating.
- Have an appropriate thumbnail.
- Have a call to action in the description.
- Be publicly listed.

#### LinkedIn

Posts should be framed in the context of FlowForge as an organisation and a team, don't get too technical. A relevant photo or image should be included in every post. Where the post is primarily of a video it should be embedded from Youtube.

#### Reddit

Keep it short, Reddit posts should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more. If the content is a video we should post that directly on Reddit as that should result in greater interaction.

#### Node-RED Slack (FlowForge section)

Keep it short, Slack messages should be factual, informal and have a call to action (a link) where a user can read more.
