## Process

As per our [Development Cadence](../development#cadence), we release a new version of FlowForge every four weeks. Work begins on formal design (mid and high-fidelity UX and visual design assets) two weeks prior to a release cycle beginning, i.e. 6 weeks ahead of the release. 

In getting a headstart on major design work, we ensure that prior thinking has been conducted on the high-level UX, and development is not blocked at the start of a release sprint. Both visual and UX design iterations will occur throughout the first two weeks of a cycle, alongside development efforts.

## Tools

If you ever require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](../peopleops#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Figma ([more info](https://www.figma.com/))

Figma is used to construct mid- and high-fidelity designs. We have two primary working documents for design iterations:

- Website
- Platform

Underlying each of these Figma files is a standardised component library, which coincides with FlowForge's `forge-ui-component` library.

### FigJam ([more info](https://www.figma.com/figjam/))

Figjam, a sister-product of Figma, is a cloud-hosted white boarding tool that enables remote, digital collaboration. 

Any in-person whiteboard discussions should have a documented digitial copy. Additionally, FigJam can be used to host and run digital workshops.


### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

For visual design elements of the user interface and public-facing material, we predominantly use Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects.

- **Illustrator** provides us tooling to create high-quality, static SVG assets to suplement the user experience on both the website and the FlowForge platform.

- **After Effects** enables the generation of animated SVG elements. In particular, we work with [Lottie Files](https://lottiefiles.com/) for injection into both our website and FlowForge platform.

Other tools included in the Creative Cloud suite that may be useful include:

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.

- **Premiere Pro** is an excellent video-editing software.

### Blender ([more info](https://blender.org))

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset. It can be used to create static renders of 3d assets, or entire 2d & 3d animations. 

### Websites

- All written content should be in UK English.
- All page titles should summarise the content, keep the URL length as short as practical and use [Kebab Case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case).
- All images should use informative [alt tags](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/tips/) which clearly describe the point of an image rather than all the details. Alt tags should be no longer than 60 characters.
- When mentioning [FlowForge Concepts](https://flowforge.com/docs/user/concepts/) (terminology) where possible we should link to an explanation of that concept.
