### Process

To start to process of approval and paying of invoices a PDF of the invoice should
be mailed to billing@flowforge.com. FlowForge pays invoices 30 days after filing 
unless specifically agreed otherwise prior to filing the invoice.

The invoice should include:
- Vendor Invoice ID
- Vendor address
- Vendor contact details
- Details of services rendered
- Amount of dollars due

#### Fraud prevention

Urgency required for payments do not warrant urgent enough to diverge from the
set process. Within the company there's _never_ a request through email or text
message.
