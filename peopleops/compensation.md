# Compensation

Total compensation consists of 3 elements, salary, equity, and benefits.
FlowForge aims to provide a total compensation package on par with similar
companies in terms of: stage of the company, market, role, and level of the role.

## Salary

Salary for each role is determined initially during the hiring process based
on compensation expectation of the candidate as well as the market rates. Salary
is based on your location you live in and the company context. FlowForge pays in
your local currency unless explicitly discussed otherwise.

### Adjustments

Salary can be increased twice a year. In September, a performance adjustment is
done. Performance review is based on values, and meeting role expectations.

Each December compensation is adjusted for each employee with the company for
over 6 months. Inflation is set to the year average for the country the employee
lives in.

## Equity

FlowForge offers equity for all roles depending on the same variables that decide
salary, except your location. Equity is offered as stock options, which upon
execution will be transformed in the underlying stock. Stock compensation are
awarded on a 4 year vesting schedule with a 1 year cliff. Equity compensation
will not vary based on employee location.

Equity is only increased on employee promotions.
