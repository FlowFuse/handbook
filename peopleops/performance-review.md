# Performance Review

In September a performance adjustment is done for all employees. The performance
review is based on [our values](../company#values), and meeting role
expectations. A review is held by the direct manager of each employeee. The
manager will write down their expectations, where these were met and where the
employee can still grow. This text is shared with each individual employee.

Performance as review might influence the [compensation adjustment](../peopleops/compensation#adjustment)
