## Vacation Policy

FlowForge has a unlimited time off policy. Taking vacation is encouraged for all
team members. To prevent an undefined number of vacation days to start a race to
the bottom, we recommend each team member to take a minimum of 25 days a year,
and at least 5 days a quarter.

### Logging time off

When taking more than 3 days off consecutively, tell (don't ask) your manager. 
This ensure scheduling of work and operations continue to run smoothly without
you. When taking over 2 weeks of consecutively seek approval from your manager.

Before you can take time off you should _always_:
* Log your time off in BambooHR
* Add an 'Out of office' appointment in your personal Google Calendar, and decline
   all meetings automatically.

## Expenses

The company will cover any reasonable work-related expense, including ensuring you
have the equipment (laptop/monitor/accessories) you need to do the job. As an
all-remote company, we meet via Zoom. As such, we will cover the cost of a good
webcam/microphone/lighting arrangement.

The general rule is: treat it like your own money - seek good value and use 
common sense. If you do require any equipment, talk to your manager to discuss options.

There are two ways of spending company money - either using a company credit card,
or through reimbursement.

### Company Credit Card

We use [Brex](https://www.brex.com/) to provide cards to the team. They are, by
default, virtual Mastercards, although there is an option to get a physical
card sent out.

### Reimbursement

If you use your own means to purchase something that ought to be covered by the
company, you can claim back the money through [work.pilot.co/expenses](https://work.pilot.co/expenses).

* Create a new expense by clicking <kbd>Add new expense</kbd>
* Enter a description, category, price and attach an invoice, then click <kbd>Add new expense</kbd>
  * This expense will now appear in your "Unreported expenses" list
* Apply a check against the expense in your "Unreported expenses" list then click <kbd>Create expense report</kbd>
* Fill out the description fields then click <kbd>Send expense report</kbd>

### Asset purchases over $500

Any asset purchase over $500 (laptops, devices etc) needs to be centrally recorded.
This is done in a Google Sheet kept in a drive shared with the Finance team that
is not generally accessible. Send details of the purchase to Nick or ZJ so it can be
recorded.
