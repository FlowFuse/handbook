### Be a community

As an open core company our community spans our employees, the open source contributors and our users. We strive to build a healthy, positive community through our values and actions.
We celebrate the diversity of others, we listen to each other, we support each other.

We are inclusive of all and are mindful of how our words and actions can impact others. We welcome discussion and debate, but take care to ensure it is not at the expense or exclusion of others. We value empathy, courtesy and respect for each other.

### Focus on results

We value results over measuring hours spent working. We do not dictate how someone should schedule their day - we trust individuals to do what is right. Everyone should feel empowered to do the work needed to achieve our goals.

There may be times when more is needed to meet a goal, deadline or customer situation. We take the responsibility to ensure they are the exceptions rather than the rule.

### Bias for action

We value getting things done and continually moving forward. It is better to iterate rapidly rather than get stuck over-thinking a problem. We move with an urgency and a focus to achieve our best.

### Use candor

We use truth as a superpower, even when inconvenient to ourselves. We use it with care and consideration of others. We won’t get everything right all of the time. The only way we can improve is by being honest with ourselves and each other. It can be difficult to achieve and it can feel awkward. When done right, with respect and a shared understanding, it can lead to a better outcome for everyone.

### Be optimistic

We will treat all situations with an optimism that a positive result is possible. We don’t let that get in the way of planning for all outcomes and making the hard choices when they are needed.
