As a distributed company we should be mindful of how we communicate.

## Timezones

### Use UTC for times

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, communicate times in UTC. This allows each
team member to remember just their offset to UTC and makes communication around
timezones less error-prone (e.g. misremembering your own offset to a collegues
timezone) and more efficient. **Exception**: When communicating to meet in 
phisical locations, the timezone of that location will be assumed as default.

### Time of day

A 24 hour clock is assumed in time notations like `10:00`, when referencing a
time in the afternoon either use e.g. `15:00` or explicitly `3 PM`.
