## Onboarding

Just before the first day working at FlowForge you'll receive an email 
requesting for GitHub username and preferred company email address. An issue
will be created at our [internal issue tracker][issue-tracker] with steps for
the team and you to complete once you started.

The day you start an email will send to your personal email address to gain
access to your FlowForge email address which you can leverage to gain access to
Slack and other resources.
