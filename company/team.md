## Hiring

### Interviews

When a candidate applied they'll have at least two interviews with two different
interviewers before an offer is extended to them. One interview will investigate
the [fit on values](../company#values). The second will be a competency based
interview.

When interviewing to hire new team members, optimize for value-fit over
culture-fit. Hiring for value-fit allows others to add to culture and thus fosters
diversity and builds inclusive teams.

## Onboarding

Just before the first day working at FlowForge you'll receive an email 
requesting for GitHub username and preferred company email address. An issue
will be created at our [internal issue tracker][issue-tracker] with steps for
the team and you to complete once you started.

The day you start an email will send to your personal email address to gain
access to your FlowForge email address which you can leverage to gain access to
Slack and other resources. On your first day you should prioritise gaining access
to Slack, the FlowForge GitHub organisation, and complete your onboarding issue.
Your manager will also assign work to start on in the first week.
