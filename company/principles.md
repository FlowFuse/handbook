# Principles

## All Remote

We are a fully remote company that puts a strong emphasis on trust and respect
for its employees, customers, partners and communities. We are able to hire the
right people from wherever they are in the world. We work openly with one
another and value clear communication and decision making without being sat in
the same room.

## Open Source Stewardship

We believe strongly that Open Source lives at the heart of everything we do. 
Ever since Node-RED was published as  an Open Source project, we have taken
great care to stay true to that principle.

Node-RED has an open governance model which means everyone has a seat at the
table. We will continue to champion that model and work with the community to
ensure anyone who wants to contribute to the project is able to.

## Everybody Codes

Inspired by [PostHog's Policy](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values#everyone-codes), FlowForge
operates under an "Everybody Codes" philosophy. Whilst this can feel very daunting, we have heard how
effective it's been at PostHog, and PostHog have a couple of articles that detail a non-coders
experience with this principle [here](https://posthog.com/blog/a-non-coders-thoughts-on-everybody-codes-culture).

This principle doesn't require everybody to be a Software Developer, and you certainly
don't need any coding experience prior to joining FlowForge.

Getting to grips with GitHub is useful though [GitHub - Entry Level Guide](../development/contributing/git-how-to.md),
as it is what we use to track our work, and enables you to contirbute directly to the Website, Handbook
and even the Product itself.
