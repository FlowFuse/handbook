## FlowForge Videos

This section of our handbook is dedicated to guidance on how to create video/media assets for FlowForge. Here you can find information on what types of videos we produce at FlowForge and the templating and formatting we recommend for each.

Our Release Videos follow a very fixed pattern:

1. FlowForge Intro Ident
2. Call out 3-4 Major Features introduced in this particular release (with screen recorded demos)
3. "and much more..." to include additional important features & bug fixes
4. FlowForge Outro Ident


#### Marketing Videos

Much more creative license and freedom in terms of content and approach. If we are using iconography and pictograms, then they should be stylized and animated as per our [branding guidelines](../design/branding).

## Assets
#### FlowForge Intro
<video width="500" controls>
  <source src="../videos/ff-intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

#### FlowForge Outro
<video width="500" controls>
  <source src="../videos/ff-outro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Tools

If you ever require a license to one of the following tools (where applicable), then please read our [licensing](../peopleops#software-licenses) section in order to attain one.

### Adobe Creative Cloud ([more info](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html))

#### Video Editing

- **After Effects** enables the generation of videos and provides control of individual animated elements within a composition. Use this if you're looking to generate bespoke animations of stylised UIs or animated icons and logos.

- **Premiere Pro** - Use this when piecing together multiple bits of footage. Premiere Pro is better for stitching existing compositions, for example, the opening/closing FlowForge idents, either side of some demo footage.

#### Image Editing

- **Illustrator** provides us tooling to create high-quality, static SVG assets to suplement the user experience on both the website and the FlowForge platform.

- **Photoshop** can be used for raster image and photo-editing.
