## Releases

### Cadence

FlowForge is released every four weeks, on a Thursday. There's 13 releases each
year. The initial release is scheduled for the 20th of January. This implies:

v0.2 is scheduled for 2022/02/17

v0.3 is scheduled for 2022/03/17

### Launch Lunch

To celebrate the launch of a new version of FlowForge, we organize a lunch on the
release day. Each team member is encouraged to order a lunch (Expensable up to 20$
per launch) and join a social lunch zoom call.
