## Development

### How we work

- [Packaging](../development/packaging.md)
- [Contributing](../development/contributing.md)
- [Staging Environment](../development/staging.md)

## Releases

Instructions for creating a release are [here](../development/release.md).

### Cadence

FlowForge is released every four weeks, on a Thursday. There are 13 releases each
year. The initial release was published on 20th of January. This implies releases
will be scheduled on the following dates.

 -  2022/04/14 (0.4)
 -  2022/05/12 (0.5)
 -  2022/06/09 (0.6)
 -  2022/07/07 (0.7)
 -  2022/08/04 (0.8)
 -  2022/09/01 (0.9)
 -  2022/09/29 (1.0)
 -  2022/10/27 (1.1)
 -  2022/11/24

### Planning

Our planning process is continually evolving as we find the right way to accommodate
both a growing team and a growing set of requirements on both how and what we deliver.

The following reflects both where we are at today and where we want to get to. That

We use GitHub issues for planning the work in a release. A Milestone should exist
for the current release (N) and the next one (N+1). We do not schedule work beyond
that as priorities can change through a release.

There are three types of issue used for planning work:

 - **Epic**: a significant feature or piece of work that doesn't easily fit into
   a single release. It will typically have a number of Stories
   and/or Tasks associated with it that can be delivered iteratively.

 - **Story**: a *user-oriented* description of a feature. It should describe what
   a user should be able to do and identify the value that brings to the user.
   A story should be deliverable in a single release.

 - **Task**: a piece of work that isn't necessarily tied to a specific Epic or Story.
   For example, items related to technical debt or house-keeping chores.


Whenever an issue is raised, it will be reviewed by the Product Owner/CTO and added
to the Product Board for prioritisation and planning. The exception to this are
tasks/bugs related to work already in progress and that need to be addressed in
the current milestone. They should be added to the Development Board and current
milestone directly.

### Project Boards

We use three project boards to plan and track our work.

 - [Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/5)
 - [Product Board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/3/views/1)
 - [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/1/views/1)

#### Roadmap Board

This is a high-level view of our product roadmap over the coming releases. It 
identifies the themes and priorities for the releases.

#### Product Board

[This board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/3/views/1) is maintained
by the Product Owner (PO) and CTO. It is the main entry point for all epics and
stories.

Items on this board have the following states:

 - `‚û°Ô∏è Incoming` - where all items start their planning journey.
   - Items are regularly prioritised and triaged on this list.
   - Items that require further refinement or design work are assigned to someone on the team.
   - When an item is assigned, move to the `üìê Design` state.
 - `üìê Design` - items that are being refined.
   - This means someone is adding more detail to the story, providing a high-level
     technical outline (database model impact, API changes) as well as any UX mockups
     or high-level descriptions. Once complete, the item is moved to the `üëÄ Review` state.
 - `üëÄ Review` - Items that are ready to be reviewed by PO/CTO (and any other stackholders)
   - This review ensures the design meets the acceptance criteria and/or is headed
     in the right direction. 
   - If more work is needed, it moves back to the `üìê Design` state.
   - If the design is approved, it moves to the `üßÆ Estimate` state.
 - `üßÆ Estimate` - items that need a rough sizing to be added.
   - Sizings are applied on a scale of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 (Fibonaci FTW) using labels.
   - Once sized, it is moved to the `‚úÖ Ready` state.
 - `‚úÖ Ready` - items that have been sufficiently designed, and sized, to allow them
   to be considered for assigning to a milestone


A weekly review is held to keep the backlog in order - triaging new items that
have been raised and not yet added to the backlog, reflecting on changing priorities
and requirements.

#### Development Board

The [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/1/views/1) is
used to plan and track the work within the current milestone release.

It has the following states:

 - `ToDo` - items assigned to the milestone but not yet started
 - `In Progress` - items being worked on
 - `Review` - items that are ready to be reviewed
 - `Done` - items that are [Done](#defining-done)

### Retrospective/Kick-Off

The day after each FlowForge release, always a Friday, a meeting is scheduled
by the CTO. This meeting includes 2 parts:

 1. A retrospective on the last release. This should capture feedback on what
    went well and what could be improved and generate action items to act on the
    feedback.
 2. Kicking off the next release. The involves:
    1. The Product Owner describing the themes, goals and priorities of the new release
    2. Reviewing the [Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/flowforge/projects/1/views/1)
       for the new milestone.
       High-priority items are assigned owners so that everyone has something to
       get started on.
    3. Identifying the release manager - the person who will co-ordinate things
       on release day.
         - Once identified, they take the action to create the next release issue
           using the [Release Template](https://github.com/flowforge/admin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=release.md&title=Release%3A)
           in the `flowforge/admin` repo.

### What to work on

Work comes from two places:

 - Items assigned for Design/Estimation on the Product Board
 - Items from the ToDo status on the Development Board

It is important we make progress on both sides to ensure a steady velocity across
milestones.

Naturally there will be items that crop up unexpectedly and have to be dealt with
pragmatically. For example, we may realise an item is needed for the current release
that needs to be expedited through the process. We should remain flexible in how
we work.

When picking up an unassigned item assign it to yourself and move it to the
**In Progress** state (for Development items) or the appropriate Product board state.

#### Milestones are overscheduled

As stories and tasks are assigned to milestones, it's unlikely there's not
enough work to be done. On the flipside, this means that not all scheduled epics
or stories will be completed.

The Product Owner/CTO have overall responsibility to ensure any 'must-have' items
are making progress in a release.

### Defining Done

An item should only be marked as 'Done' on the Development board when the following
criteria are met:

 - All related code changes have been merged
 - Suitable unit/system level tests have been added
 - Documentation has been updated
 - Acceptance criteria identified in the Story have been met
 - Product Owner accepts the story is complete
